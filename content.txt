-> Usage

- Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.
(Add environement-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE)

- The .env file should never be committed to the source code repository. 
We must place the file into the .gitgnore file.
(When using git.)

- [THe .env parsing rules] :
  * the variables are written in uppercase letters (e.g. PORT)
  * empty lines are skipped
  * comments start with #
  * empty values become emty strings
  * Existing environement variables are not modified; they are skipped.

  - require and configure dotenv.
  require('dotenv).config()
